## Introduction

This repository started as mocked interviews between me and [@elahe-dastan](https://github.com/elahe-dastan) then I decided to gather all together at our teaching organization, so other people can use it too.
Now this repository contains sample problems for all stages in technical interview.
Please fill issue in case of any problem with these questions.

## Before Interview (As an Interviewee)

1. Only have these tabs open:

- Gmail: Maybe they want to share a Google document with you
- [GoByExample](https://gobyexample.com/): Maybe they let you review concepts in their live coding session,
  so having this at your hand to find out your challenges.
- [Golang](https://pkg.go.dev/)

2. Have your anti-sanction service up and running
3. It is ok that you talk to yourself but try to do dispose of everything you don't know :)
4. Don't have any stress, they are as senior as you :D

## Before Interview (As an Interviewer)

1. Create a Markdown document contains your problems, questions and hands-on coding. (you can store these for future references)
2. Create another google document to share it with your interviewee and put the hands-on coding there.
3. Make yourself clean and ready to share video (if this is a video interview)
4. Review on your company introduction to make sound and clean

## What happens during an interview?

First HR is going to set up a call and ask about the general conditions of interviewee.
This call is not technical and actually about things like current employment status, your timings, etc.

### First Focus Interview

It is better to start with greetings and then introducing you and your company then ask him/her to introduce himself/herself.
Then you can ask typical questions like:

- Challenges which you are proud of
- University
  - Major
  - Courses
- Where do you see yourself in the next 5 years?
- Why and when did you get promoted?
- Why do you think /company/ is for you?

Also, you can ask about your business and tell him/her more about what you are actually doing.

### Second Focus Interview

For the second meeting you can start by coding or system design (even you can ask both of them in a one meeting).
