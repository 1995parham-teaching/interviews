\section{Hands-on Problems}

Problems can be written in a shared google document in whatever language Interviewee likes.

\subsection{Shuffle}

You have an array with n-items named $A$.
We want to partition it into $k$-subarrays that each of them has $n/k$ items, and each element of $A$ appears precisely once.
The order of these subarrays must not be the same as the $A$ and also we know that: $n \% k == 0$.
For example:

\begin{minted}[bgcolor=Black]{python}
A = [1, 2, 3, 4]
k = 2
\end{minted}

we don't accept the following solution:

\begin{minted}[bgcolor=Black]{python}
A1 = [1, 2]
A2 = [3, 4]
\end{minted}

but we accept the following solution:

\begin{minted}[bgcolor=Black]{python}
A1 = [1, 3]
A2 = [2, 4]
\end{minted}

\begin{itemize}
  \item with duplication or without duplication?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Coins}

We have $n$ amount of money and our country have the following coins:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item coin-1
  \item coin-5
  \item coin-7
  \item coin-10
\end{enumerate}

we want to have this money with minimum number of coins.\ what is the minimum number of required coins?
for eaxmple:

\begin{minted}[bgcolor=Black]{python}
2 = 2 * coin_1
5 = 1 * coin_5
6 = 1 * coin_5 + 1 * coin-1
\end{minted}

\subsection{$k$ nearest point}

We have $n$ points and one reference point.
Each point has $x$ and $y$ coordinates.
We want to find $k$ the nearest points to the reference point.
For example:

\begin{minted}[bgcolor=Black]{python}
import dataclasses

@dataclasses.dataclass()
class Point:
  x: float
  y: float

points = [
  Point(0, 0), Point(0, 1), Point(1, 1), Point(1, 0),
  Point(-1, -1), Point(0, -1), Point(-1, 0),
]
reference = Point(-1, -1)
n = len(points)
k = 2

k_nearest_points = [Point(-1, -1), Point(-1, 0)]
# or
k_nearest_points = [Point(-1, -1), Point(0, -1)]
\end{minted}
