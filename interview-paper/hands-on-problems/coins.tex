\subsection{Coins}

We have $n$ amount of money and our country have the following coins:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item coin-1
  \item coin-5
  \item coin-7
  \item coin-10
\end{enumerate}

we want to have this money with minimum number of coins.\ what is the minimum number of required coins?
for eaxmple:

\begin{minted}[bgcolor=Black]{python}
2 = 2 * coin_1
5 = 1 * coin_5
6 = 1 * coin_5 + 1 * coin-1
\end{minted}
