\subsection{Shuffle}

You have an array with n-items named $A$.
We want to partition it into $k$-subarrays that each of them has $n/k$ items, and each element of $A$ appears precisely once.
The order of these subarrays must not be the same as the $A$ and also we know that: $n \% k == 0$.
For example:

\begin{minted}[bgcolor=Black]{python}
A = [1, 2, 3, 4]
k = 2
\end{minted}

we don't accept the following solution:

\begin{minted}[bgcolor=Black]{python}
A1 = [1, 2]
A2 = [3, 4]
\end{minted}

but we accept the following solution:

\begin{minted}[bgcolor=Black]{python}
A1 = [1, 3]
A2 = [2, 4]
\end{minted}

\begin{itemize}
  \item with duplication or without duplication?
\end{itemize}
